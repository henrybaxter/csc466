- attempt to connect over 80 with google chrome using quic
- note that apache is already running, right because of build deps for chromium
- so for now we shut it down completely
- will not work
- right, 443 only (secure only)
- here is what is needed to make it work:
 - need to install root CA on local machine
 - open 443 for udp with AWS security group
 - edit /etc/hosts to point www.example.org to 52.33.172.103
 - run chrome with origin-to-force-quic-on (not entirely sure it's necessary, seems to work without now!)
 - open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --origin-to-force-quic-on=www.example.org:443 https://www.example.org
